== Flexible Invoices in a nutshell ==

Flexible PDF Invoices for WooCommerce & WordPress is a plugin for invoicing in WooCommerce. You can use it to invoice orders in your WooCommerce store. Also, it perfectly runs in a standalone WordPress, so you can invoice your services directly in the WordPress dashboard.

PRO version automates issuing WooCommerce PDF invoices. The plugin lets you create three types of documents - invoice, proforma, and correction invoice. If you need more info on your WooCommerce invoice, you may add additional notes as well.

The PRO version will help you issue invoices under the MOSS and OSS procedure too! Individual customers will receive documents with the proper EU VAT number and VAT on the invoice. The business buyers will get reverse charge PDF invoices for WooCommerce orders thanks to the automatic EU VAT number validation in the checkout.

The PRO version supports WooCommerce integration with many features like full EU VAT support for the vat invoice. The plugin generates WooCommerce PDF invoices automatically with full support for EU transactions. Also, thanks to the plugin, you may issue manual invoices in WordPress and a WooCommerce invoice any time you want. See how easy it is to configure the plugin, generate, send, and download invoices :)

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin like any other WordPress plugin.
1. Download and unzip the latest release of the plugin.
2. Upload the entire plugin directory to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in the WordPress Administration.

You can also use WordPress uploader to upload the plugin zip file in WordPress menu Plugins -> Add New -> Upload Plugin. Then go directly to point 3.

[Read more in the plugin documentation to see how to issue a WooCommerce invoice manually](https://docs.flexibleinvoices.com/article/803-manual-issuing-proforma-and-invoices). If you want to issue WooCommerce PDF invoices automatically, [check out the automatic sending option in the documentation](https://docs.flexibleinvoices.com/article/794-invoice-settings) that is available in the PRO version of the plugin.

= Can I generate the correction for a WooCommerce invoice? =

This option is available in the PRO version. You may read about the PRO feature in the article about [issuing correction invoice for WooCommerce orders](https://flexibleinvoices.com/blog/woocommerce-invoice-corrections/).

= Is the plugin compliant with EU law? =

Yes. The plugin is compatible with EU law (EU vat, VAT number field, vat exemption, reverse charge, VAT validation in the VIES database, OSS support, currency exchange table on the WooCommerce invoice). You may read more about the plugin's PRO features in the [Flexible Invoices for WooCommerce following the EU law article!](https://flexibleinvoices.com/blog/flexible-invoices-woocommerce-following-the-eu-law/)

= Can the plugin show vat number on WooCommerce invoices? =

Yes. You may turn on the VAT number in the [plugin's settings of the WooCommerce checkout](https://docs.flexibleinvoices.com/article/811-checkout-form). The WooCommerce invoice will then receive the VAT number automatically.

The plugin generates PDF invoices with WooCommerce order positions according to the tax settings in your store. You may also edit or/ and add a WordPress/ WooCommerce invoice manually to have the proper EU VAT number and annotation according to the type of the customer.

The plugin in the PRO version allows you to create both reverse charge invoices and WooCommerce invoices with the correct VAT according to the customer type (individual or company) **100% automatically**! This is possible thanks to the built-in EU VAT number validation for the WooCommerce invoice (let's call this feature an EU vat invoice checker).

When WooCommerce is activated the plugin will use its currency settings and the current store's currency when issuing an invoice.

In the PRO version, you may also benefit from the currency exchange table on the WooCommerce PDF invoice with VAT. Currency conversion rates are taken from the European Central Bank automatically. You may read more on [how to issue currency invoices in WooCommerce](https://flexibleinvoices.com/blog/currency-invoices-woocommerce/) article.

= Is the plugin translation ready and has WPML support? =

Yes. You may translate it and also add your [translation for other users of the plugin](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/flexible-invoices).

The plugin supports WPML as well. Read more about [translating documents and Flexible Invoices](https://docs.flexibleinvoices.com/article/791-translating-documents).
